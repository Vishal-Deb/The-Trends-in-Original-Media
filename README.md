# The-Trends-in-Original-Media

## Background and Overview

The media and entertainment industry has undergone rapid expansion with the rise of global streaming platforms. The proliferation of content across multiple formats—films, television series, and short productions—has created both opportunities and challenges in understanding what drives audience engagement and critical reception.

This dataset captures a cross-section of information from IMDb, including identifiers, titles, content type, production studio, audience ratings, vote counts, genres, release years, and runtime (where available). Together, these variables provide a structured foundation for analyzing patterns in content creation and performance.

The primary objective of this project is to extract insights that highlight:

- The distribution of content types and production volumes across studios.

- The relationship between audience ratings, popularity (votes), and content genres.

- Trends in release frequency and runtime characteristics over time.

- Comparative performance of major studios and platforms.

By focusing on measurable outcomes such as ratings, popularity, and production diversity, the analysis is designed to surface actionable insights with direct implications for content strategy, platform differentiation, and audience targeting.

This work also establishes a framework for future extensions, including the integration of external performance indicators (such as revenue data or streaming hours) and predictive modeling to anticipate audience reception.
